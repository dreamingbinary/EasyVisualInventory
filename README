Easy Visual Inventory is a simple android application which allows you to keep inventory of your stock, sales, etc.  It is quite simple.  For an end user, it would be useful for small shopkeepers.  For developers, it provides a nice base from which to base inventory applications.  The first android application I ever wrote, and the first in my '65 apps in 60 days' period.  BSD licensed so you can use it at work.
